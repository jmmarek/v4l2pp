{"name":"V4L2pp","tagline":"C++ object oriented interface for V4L2 library","body":"# v4l2pp\r\nObject oriented interface for well known library Video4Linux2 (V4L2).\r\nThis is wrapper for C++ language. It is to use V4L2 using a few commands.\r\n\r\nIt allows to get image from camera easily as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n     V4L2::Camera camera(640, 480);\r\n     // Select device\r\n     camera.setDevice(\"/dev/video0\");\r\n     // Open device\r\n     camera.open();\r\n     // Start capturing\r\n     camera.startCapturing();\r\n     // While capturing it is possible to get image\r\n     unsigned char *image = camera.getImage();\r\n     // Release resources before exit\r\n     camera.stopCapturing();\r\n     camera.close();\r\n\r\nIt is very simple and may have some bugs, which I hope to fix soon.\r\n\r\nEveryone who is interested in contribution this wrapper, please contact me (ementos at gmail dott com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
